MyloTEAM’s platform has vast functionality and integrates deeply with Salesforce to handle your client experience.  Create role based users so support staff have what they need without sifting through all the data.  Attendees may have different value to you, so go ahead, create ticket registrations of all types and market to your invitees using promo codes and discounts.   Want to see if an invitation has been opened or if the invitee is registered?  Our Salesforce integration shows you where things are in the moment.  It’s the day of your event.  Shut down long check in lines and check attendees in using MyloTEAM’s Smartphone scanner, then hand them a custom branded badge.  Send a custom report to the caterer and leaders of breakout sessions. Now loop back and run reports to see information without using unwieldy manual spreadsheets.</p>

	                               <p>It’s the first ever annual event for global professional association and attendees are flying in from all over the world.  Many of the members had participated in events over the year, including local lunch and learns hosted by their partners, as well as monthly meetups and webinars. Success dictated whether there would be a year two and information on each attendee was critical to create a personalized event without too much time overhead. The event managment team used MyloTEAM to look at each attendee’s event history, as people, and offer various registration types based on membership as well as create breakouts based on common interests over attendee history.  All the attendee registration information, including event type, dietary needs and breakout placement was available, up to the moment, when attendees arrived and picked up their badge, also created in the MyloTEAM solution.  Registration was far better than expected so the event staff used the MyloTEAM waitlist feature to ensure that the event had no empty seats and those waitlisted were informed that a seat was open now.  The day of the Using MyloTEAM event management software, reports were run relevant to the support staff’s task.  Support staff sent role based reports, via a link, to caterers for dietary information,  and breakout leaders to see who signed up for which session.  When two of the breakout rooms became unavailable at the last minute,  event managers emailed appropriate attendees to direct them to the new rooms.  Better yet the attendees were able to use Social World, a private social network, to connect with each other in unique groups set up for their interest area and could communicate with each other.</p>

                                    Like so many other global professional organizations the is one had a disparate member base, each with unique needs, but they all had the same desires to complete quarterly and annual classes.  The headquarters needed to be able to see where the classes were being taken and how. Previously they had used a online event system for the classes and had no idea, without use of many spreadsheets, how class registrations were unfolding,  It took three admins who shared various document across the globe and in many cases the classes were losing money because they could not forecast.

                                     MyloTEAM allowed the organization to plan a training curriculum that supported live classes for the bigger cities, online live classes for people who lived in the same region as their instructors, and on-demand classes, recorded previously, for some of their outlying members in time zones that matched.  They were able to give time based discounts to increase early registrations and promotions for students who were enrolling in follow on classes. Students had the option of Visa, Master Card or even PayPal to enroll, and the organization could track each day where revenues were flowing from. The end of each class cycle allowed them to see the increasing trend for on-demand classes even in their busy cities. Through changes to training offerings, based on this data,  they saw an increase in revenues by 20% and class attendance completion of 40%.</p>

This spans from healthcare, where people’s lives depend on certified health workers, to technology where students are pursuing technical certification as a means of entering the job market faster or proving they have skills to pivot in their career.</p>
